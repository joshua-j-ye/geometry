### User Request
> I am doing a hobby project with my son Joshua. We want to build a simple game like geometry dash. 
> Create a simple playable first version for us, so we can test, and deploy to my home server. 
> Use html, javascript, css.

### Solution Delivered

#### Files Created:
1. **index.html** - Main game HTML structure
2. **style.css** - Game styling and responsive design
3. **game.js** - Complete game logic and mechanics
4. **README.md** - Game documentation and instructions

#### Game Features Implemented:

##### Core Gameplay:
- ✅ Cube player character with jump mechanics
- ✅ Obstacle avoidance gameplay
- ✅ Progressive difficulty (speed increases over time)
- ✅ Collision detection system
- ✅ Game over and restart functionality

##### Visual Features:
- ✅ HTML5 Canvas rendering
- ✅ Gradient backgrounds and styling
- ✅ Particle effects on jump
- ✅ Player rotation animation
- ✅ Animated background clouds
- ✅ Responsive mobile-friendly design

##### User Interface:
- ✅ Score tracking system
- ✅ High score persistence (localStorage)
- ✅ Game over screen with statistics
- ✅ Start/restart buttons
- ✅ Control instructions

##### Controls:
- ✅ Keyboard control (SPACE key)
- ✅ Mouse click control
- ✅ Touch screen support for mobile

#### Technical Implementation Details:

##### HTML Structure:
- Game container with header, canvas, and controls
- Score display and game over modal
- Responsive viewport meta tag

##### CSS Styling:
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Responsive design with media queries
- Button hover effects and animations
- Pulse animation for new records

##### JavaScript Game Engine:
- Object-oriented class structure (`GeometryJump` class)
- Game loop with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Physics system with gravity and collision detection
- Particle system for visual effects
- Local storage for high score persistence
- Progressive difficulty scaling

#### Code Architecture:

```javascript
class GeometryJump {
    constructor()           // Initialize game state
    initEventListeners()    // Set up controls
    startGame()            // Game start logic
    jump()                 // Player jump mechanics
    updatePlayer()         // Physics and movement
    spawnObstacle()        // Obstacle generation
    checkCollisions()      // Collision detection
    gameOver()             // End game logic
    draw()                 // Rendering system
    gameLoop()             // Main game loop
}
```

#### Deployment Instructions:
1. **Local Testing**: Open `index.html` in web browser
2. **Home Server**: Copy all files to web server directory
3. **No Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS - no build process required

#### Game Mechanics:
- **Player**: 30x30px cube with jump physics
- **Obstacles**: Spawn every 150 frames (decreasing)
- **Scoring**: 10 points per obstacle passed
- **Physics**: Gravity (0.6), Jump power (-12)
- **Speed**: Starts at 2px/frame, increases by 0.002 per frame

#### Future Enhancement Ideas:
- 🎵 Sound effects and background music
- 🌟 Power-ups and special abilities
- 🎨 Multiple character skins
- 🏅 Achievement system
- 🌍 Different levels/environments
- 👥 Multiplayer features
- 📊 Statistics tracking
